                    <p>
                         I was looking for you in the garden
                        The shadows under the trees perforated night skies
                        I found it hard to see in the glare
                        The only response to a call was the rustle of leaves, birdsong
                        Your name diffusing through the undulations in the air
                        The kitchen doors were open
                        I checked the fridge before continuing
                        Skipping stairs was a stretch but still a habit
                        Years later, a couple lanes away from where we lived
                        I watched an asteroid break up on entry
                        Bright limbs streaking across a black sky
                        What were the chances ?
                        Miracles unfolding overhead
                        Drinking in the park
                    </p>
                </section>

                    <section class="lower">
                        <p>I could never explain the pit in my stomach
                        Frantic, nervous pacing through the house
                        If we act like things are not spiraling out of hand
                        Does that make them so?
                        If a thought goes unspoken, does that erase it ?
                        The unbroached belief when my friend died decades later, that subconscious echoes carried him through me
                        But it never rears its head when it can be reasoned with
                        The world ends on a quiet weekend
                        Not through diagnoses, emergencies, collapses -
                        Although I hate thinking that memories bend</p>
