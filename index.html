             <main>I was looking for you in the garden
            The shadows under the trees perforated night skies
            I found it hard to see in the glare
            The only response to a call was the rustle of leaves, birdsong
            Your name diffusing through the undulations in the air
            The kitchen doors were open
            I checked the fridge before continuing
            Skipping stairs was a stretch but still a habit
            Years later, a couple lanes away from where we lived
            I watched an asteroid break up on entry
            Bright limbs streaking across a black sky
            What were the chances ?
            Miracles unfolding overhead
            Drinking in the park
